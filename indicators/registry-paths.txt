Steam Impersonation

HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam
HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\ActiveProcess
HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\Apps\3545990
HKCU\Software\Valve\Steam\Apps\3218580
HKCU\Software\Valve\Steamtools

Observed behavior:

Writes to Steam-related registry paths to mimic a valid Steam installation
Uses fake or unrelated Steam App IDs to reinforce the illusion of game ownership or activity
Likely intended to deceive users, security tools, or manual inspection while payload execution continues in the background




Windows Update Tampering (Defense Evasion)
The script modifies Windows Update configuration to suppress system updates

HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsUpdate\UX\Settings




Modified values include:

FlightSettingsMaxPauseDays
PauseFeatureUpdatesStartTime
PauseFeatureUpdatesEndTime
PauseQualityUpdatesStartTime
PauseQualityUpdatesEndTime
PauseUpdatesStartTime
PauseUpdatesExpiryTime

Impact:

System-wide update suppression via HKLM
Prevents security patches and Defender-related updates
Increases persistence window and reduces likelihood of detection




Summary

This behavior demonstrates:

Abuse of a trusted application registry namespace (Steam)
User deception through fake application artifacts
Defense evasion via long-term Windows Update suppression

Assessment:

Reasonable
Technically accurate
Clear malicious intent when combined with staged payload delivery
